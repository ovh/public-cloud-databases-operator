# public-cloud-databases-operator
 
This operator allow you to automaticaly authorize your Kubernetes cluster IP on your OVHcloud cloud databases service.

## Ovh Credentials
The operator needs a secret that contains the credentials to call Ovhcloud api. Go to https://api.ovh.com/createToken/ to generate the credentials namely:
- application key
- application secret
- consumer key

## Values
Create a values.yaml to be injected in the helm chart 
that will be created afterwards. Region is either: ovh-eu, ovh-ca or ovh-us.
You can find the file in /examples.
```yaml
ovhCredentials:
  applicationKey: XXXX
  applicationSecret: XXXX
  consumerKey: XXXX
  region: XXXX

namespace: XXXX #Your Kubernetes namespace
```

## Installation
Use the kubernetes package manager [helm](https://helm.sh) and the values file you created to install the operator.

```bash
helm install -f values.yaml public-cloud-databases-operator oci://registry-1.docker.io/ovhcom/public-cloud-databases-operator --version 3
```
That will create the operator, crd and secrets.
 ```bash
kubectl get deploy
NAME                                       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
operator-public-cloud-databases-operator   0/1     1            0           11h

kubectl get crd services.clouddatabases.ovhcloud.net
NAME                                   CREATED AT
services.clouddatabases.ovhcloud.net   2023-03-07T19:32:37Z

kubectl get secret ovh-credentials
NAME              TYPE                      DATA   AGE
ovh-credentials   kubernetes.io/storageos   4      9h
```

## Create Custom Resource
Create a custom resource object using this example file.
You can find the file in /examples.
```yaml
 {
        "apiVersion": "clouddatabases.ovhcloud.net/v1alpha1",
        "kind": "services",
        "metadata": {
          "name": "XXXX",
          "namespace": "XXXX"
        },
        "spec": {
          "projectId": "XXXX",
          "serviceId": "XXXX",
          "labelSelector": # No label selector means apply on all nodes
            "matchLabels":
              "LABELNAME": "LABELVALUE"
        },
      }
```

The field serviceId is optional. If not set, the operator will be run against all the services of your project.

```bash
kubectl apply -f cr.yaml
```

# Nodes Labels
You can use kubernetes labeling in order to select specific nodes that you want the operator to be run against. 
The created CR and the node must have the same label and value.

```bash
kubectl label nodes NODENAME1 NODENAME2 ... LABELNAME=LABELVALUE
```
